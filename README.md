### Size estimation

[Flow cytometry estimate](genome-size/flowcy/README.md)  
Estimated at 1.7 -2.3 Gbp

[K-mer based estimates](genome-size/kmer-distribution/README.md)  
Estimated at 1.75 Gbp, 70% repeats, and heterozygosity of 1.83.

### Sequencing

[HiFi raw and filtered summaries](sequencing/hifi/)  
Using 1.75Gbp as the genomize size, there is 44x raw reads and 43x after filtering contaminants, most of which was bactieria.

Omni-C summaries coming...

### Assembly

Flye - currently testing
