## Gene duplications  

The scripts above contain commands for both Gaviota tarplant and Helianthus annuus.  

Using https://github.com/qiao-xin/DupGen_finder  
First duplicate genes are identified (diamond.sh)  
Then duplicates are categorized (dups.sh)  

From this, the WGD genes only are used for the remaining steps.  

Then https://github.com/qiao-xin/Scripts_for_GB  

Ks values are added to the gene blocks (wgd.sh)  
These are binned and a line is plotted (peaks.sh)  

The results are above as pdfs.
