Notes from Zack Bower at Ohalo:

We resolved the issues from Friday by using some different plants as internal controls (picked up from the grocery store). This gives a 1C of about 2.2pg (around 1.7 to 2.3 Gb) for your Gaviota Tarplant. A more accurate reading would require growing out/obtaining dedicated flow cytometry standards from Dole≈æel as there can be a little bit of genome size difference within a species. See the attached excel file for a summary of the data and the calculations. In all 3 pictures, the tarplant peak is the one on the left and the internal control is the one on the right. We'll try to get the raw .fcs files off the computer later tonight and send those over to you as well. 

Jud Ward:
We have those standards in the refrigerator so we could pull them out and germinate if you have more plant material to run flow on in a few weeks.

Zack Bower: 
Attached is the raw data in a file type that can be read by other programs. We ran each species separately so we knew which peaks belonged to which species when they were run together and to confirm that they wouldn't interfere with each other. The actual genome size calculations are based on when the unknown (tarplant) and the internal control (different species of known genome size) are run together. We abbreviated Gaviota Tarplant as "GT". Sandra compared both leaf and flower petal tissue for Gaviota Tarplant and the flower petals produced a bit nicer peak, so we used that as the tissue for all the files attached here. We also used flower petals for sunflower, but leaf tissue for corn and lettuce. The flower petals produced only a single peak, but leaf tissue often produces a second peak corresponding to dividing or endoreduplicated cells.
